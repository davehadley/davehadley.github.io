title: Macrometer Privacy Policy
---

Macrometer runs entirely on your device without a server-side component.
No nutrition or personal health data ever leaves your device and no personal
information is collected by the developer. 

A third party service, [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/),
is used to collect crash reports. If Macrometer crashes during normal use, 
it will send certain information about the incident to Crashlytics.
This information consists of the device type, OS version and certain hardware
information about your mobile device, and the time of the crash, the state of
the application at the time of the crash, and stack traces. The information
does not include your IP address or any other information that could be used
to identify you or your mobile device individually, and does not include any
other information from your mobile device.
