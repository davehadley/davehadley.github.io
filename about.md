In my day job as a particle physicist I try to help us understand what stuff
there is and how it works, at a fundamental level.

I am currently a Research Fellow in the particle physics group at the
[University of Warwick](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/epp/). My main research interest is in neutrino physics.
Despite being discovered quite some time ago, there is still a lot that we don't
know about the neutrinos.
My main focus is on the [T2K experiment](http://t2k-experiment.org/),
a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment,
and the [Hyper-Kamiokande](http://www.hyperk.org/) experiment, a proposed future upgrade to [Super-Kamiokande](http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/index-e.html).

Before joining the Warwick group, I completed my PhD at the
[University of Birmingham](http://www.ep.ph.bham.ac.uk/) on the [ATLAS experiment](http://atlas.cern/),
where I contributed to searches for the Higgs boson.
